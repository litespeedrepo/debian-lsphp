# The LSPHP
LiteSpeed PHP is an optimized compilation of PHP built to work with LiteSpeed products through the LiteSpeed SAPI.

## Installation

### Prebuilt packages 
The easiest way to get up and running with PHP is to use the LiteSpeed Repository. The LiteSpeed Repository comes with prebuilt PHP packages with LiteSpeed support built in.
